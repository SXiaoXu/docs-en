# Web Hosting Development Guide &middot; {{platformName}}


Web hosting is a sub-module of the LeanEngine; it allows you to develop a web application with {{platformName}}. 

It provides cloud functions and Hook, hosting for static files and customized routing, and it can also bind your own domain name to the application. 
You can use it to create an introduction and download page for your mobile applications, developing an administrator console or a complete website, or running some custom logic that are mandatory to run on the server side.

If you don't know how to create a LeanEngine project, debug it locally and deploy it to the cloud, you can firstly read [LeanEngine Quick Start] (leanengine_quickstart.html). Other related documents include:
 
 - [LeanEngine Service Overview] (leanengine_overview.html) (Overview of all features)
 - [Command Line Tool Usage Guide] (leanengine_cli.html)
 - [LeanCache Usage Guide] (leancache_guide.html) (using the in-memory cache service to improve performance)
 - [LeanEngine Project Example] (leanengine_examples.html)
 - [LeanEngine FAQs] (leanengine_faq.html)

This document uses {{platformName}} as an example, but the LeanEngine supports many other languages. You can choose the technology stack you are familiar with for development:

- [Node.js](leanengine_webhosting_guide-node.html)
- [Python](leanengine_webhosting_guide-python.html)
- [PHP](leanengine_webhosting_guide-php.html)
- [Java](leanengine_webhosting_guide-java.html)
- [.NET](leanengine_webhosting_guide-dotnet.html)


## Starting with the example project

{% block getting_started %}{% endblock %}

### Local operation and debugging

After ensuring that all dependencies are properly installed, in the project root directory, you can use our command line tool to start debugging locally:


```sh
lean up
```

More content about the command line tool and local debugging, please refer to the [Command Line Tool Usage Guide](leanengine_cli.html).

### Deploy to the cloud


Run in your project root directory:

```sh
lean deploy
```

###  Setting up the domain name

In the "Web Hosting Domain Name" section of [LeanEngine > Settings] (/cloud.html?appid={{appid}}#/conf), you can fill in a custom second-level domain name. For example, you set `myapp` , then you can access your website through our second-level domain name:

- `http://myapp.leanapp.cn`（Chinese Area）
- `http://myapp.avosapps.us`（US Area）

<div class="callout callout-info">DNS You may need to wait a few hours till it takes into effect</div>

Our second-level domain is by default supported by HTTPS.

If your app has no visit within 30 days and does not purchase a standard instance, the second-level domain may be recycled.

## Health monitoring

When your application is starting, the LeanEngine's hypervisor will check if your application is started successfully every second. If it is still not started successfully after **30 seconds**, it means that the startup fails. After the application starts running normally, there will also be regular “health monitoring” to ensure your app is running properly.  And if health monitoring fails, the LeanEngine hypervisor will automatically restart your app.


The URL for the health monitoring includes homepage of your application(`/`) and {{platformName}}SDK  which is responsible for `/__engine/1/ping` . As long as  **one of the two** returns a response of HTTP 200, you can considered it as a success. So make sure your program uses the {{platformName}} SDK, or your app ** home page will return an HTTP 200** response normally.
In addition, in order to support the cloud function and Hook function of the LeanEngine, the hypervisor will use the URL of `/1.1/functions/_ops/metadatas` to interact with the {{platformName}} SDK. Please ensure that this URL is given to {{ The platformName}} SDK to handle, or ** returns an HTTP 404 indicating that the function will not use the cloud function** or Hook related functions.

{% block ping %}	
About how to load {{platformName}} SDK, please refer to the previous section [Using Data Storage Service] (#Using Data Storage Service)
{% endblock %}

{% block generalFeature %}

## User Status management

{% block cookie_session %}{% endblock %}

## Website common function realisation

### Sending HTTP request

{% block http_client %}{% endblock %}

### Obtain Client-end IP

If you want to get the client's IP, you can get it directly from the `x-real-ip` field of the HTTP header requested by the user. The sample code is as follows:

{% block code_get_client_ip_address %}{% endblock %}

### Upload Files
Website projects that are hosted on {{productName}} can directly handle file uploads directly using the API file-related interfaces of the built-in LeanCloud {{sdk_name}} SDK. 

Assume the front-end HTML code written like this:

```html
<form enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post" action="/upload">
  <input type="file" name="iconImage">
  <input type="submit" name="submit" value="submit">
</form>
```

{% block upload_file_special_middleware %}{% endblock %}

Next, define the handler function for the file uploading, build a Form object, parse req as a parameter, it will save the requested files to the temporary file directory, and construct the files object:

{% block code_upload_file_sdk_function %}{% endblock %}

### Session
{% block custom_session %}
{{platformName}} Not supported yet
{% endblock %}

### CSRF Token
If your LeanEngine application uses cookies as an authentication method (for example, using the SDK's CookieSession middleware); then there is a risk of being attacked by [CSRF](https://github.com/pillarjs/understanding-csrf). It will allow other sites to forge malicious requests with the correct cookies.

The industry usually uses CSRF Token to defend against CSRF statistics. You need to pass a random string (that is, CSRF Token, which can be passed through the cookie) to the client-end. The client-end must include CSRF in the request body or in the header. The server needs to verify that the CSRF Token is correct. 

{% block csrf_token %}{% endblock %}

{% endblock %}

### LeanCache

{% block leancache %}{% endblock %}

For more instruction on how to use LeanCache, see the [LeanCache Usage Guide] (leancache_guide.html).

### HTTPS Redirect to HTTP


For security consideration, we may add HTTPS encrypted transmissions to the websites. Our {{productName}} supports web hosting and it also has such a requirement.

For this reason,  we provide a new middleware in {{productName}} to force your website `{{var_app_domain}}.leanapp.cn` to be accessed via https, you just have to do this:

{% block https_redirect %}{% endblock %}

After deploying and publishing to the production environment, accessing your {{productName}} site's second-level domain will be forced to access via HTTPS.


{% block extra_examples %}{% endblock %}

## Deploy and publish


### Command line deploy

Run in you project root directory:

```sh
lean deploy
```

Using command line tools makes it easy to deploy, publish, view application status, view logs, and even support multiple application deployments. Please refer to the [Command Line Tool Guide] (leanengine_cli.html) for specific usage.

### Dependent cache

The LeanEngine implements a caching mechanism to speed up the build up process. The so-called build up means the process of installing dependencies on your LeanEngine. Each time you construct, if the dependencies are not being added or deleted, then you can use the last dependencies. You only need to replace the new application code.

{% block depentencyCache %}{% endblock %}

If you are encountering problems with installing dependencies, you can checkmark the "Download latest dependencies" option during console deployment, or add the `--no-cache` option when deploying via command line tools; dependency caching will also fail for a number of reasons. Therefore, there is no guarantee that the cache can be utilized for each build up.

```sh
lean deploy --no-cache
```

### Git Deploy 

In addition to this, you can also use git repository deployment. You need to submit the project to a git repository. We don't provide the source version management function, but instead, we use git- an excellent distributed version management tool. We recommend that you use  third parties source code hosting website like [GitHub] (https://github.com/), [Coding](https://coding.net/) or [code cloud] (https://gitee.com/). Or you can also use your own git repository (such as [Gitlab] (http://gitlab.org/))

You need to create a project on these platforms first (if you already have the code, please do not select "Initialize this repository with a README"), fill in the local machine's SSH public key in the personal settings of the website (take GitHub as an example, Settings => SSH and GPG keys click New SSH key), then execute in the project directory:

```sh
git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/<repoName>.git
git push -u origin master
```

Then fill in the Git repository address in the LeanEngine settings interface. If it is a public repository, it is recommended to fill in the https address, such as `https://github.com/<username>/<repoName>.git`. 

If it is a private repository, you need to fill in the ssh address `git@github.com:<username>/<repoName>.git`, you also need to public key which was assigned to your LeanEngine to the Deploy keys of the third-party hosting platform. Take GitHub for example, click Add deploy key in the project's Settings => Deploy keys.

After the set up, if you need the deloy code in the future, you can directly click “Deploy” in the deployment interface of the LeanEngine. 
By default, it will deploy the code of the master branch. You can also fill in the branch ,label or specific Commit during deployment.

### Preparatory environment and production environment
By default, the LeanEngine only has one "production environment" and the corresponding domain name is `{{var_app_domain}}.leanapp.cn`. There is an "experience example" in the production environment to run the application.

When the experience example of the production environment is upgraded to "Standard example", there will be an additional "preparation environment" with corresponding domain name `stg-{{var_app_domain}}.leanapp.cn`, both environments access the same data. You can test your LeanEngine code with the prepared environment. Each time you modify it, you can deploy it to the prepared environment first. After the test is passed, you can publish it to the production environment. If you want to have a test environment with an independent data source, it is recommended to create an application separately.

<div class="callout callout-info"> If you encounter an "Application not Found" error when access the LeanEngine, it is usually because the corresponding environment has not yet being deployed the code. For example, an application may not have a preparation environment, or the application has not yet released code to the production environment. </div>

Sometimes you may need to know what environment the current LeanEngine is running in (development, pre- or production) and then do different operations:

{% block get_env %}{% endblock %}

Client-end sdk has methods similiar to `setProduction` , for example [AV.setProduction(production) of JavaScript SDK API](leanengine_cloudfunction_guide-node.html#hash1210911107). If the `production` here is set to `0` ,then the SDK will request a preparation environment; if set to `1` , it will request the production environment. The default setting is `1`.

## Cloud environment

### System level dependency

System-level dependencies refer to some common functional modules on the operating system during an operating process, such as [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/). If you need to use the current project, just add The system dependencies section  in the `leanengine.yaml` file, you can specify the required system dependencies, similar to:

```yaml
systemDependencies:
  - imagemagick
```

Currently supported options include:

- `ffmpeg`An audio and video processing tool library
- `imagemagick` An image processing tool library
- `fonts-wqy`  Wenquanyi Bitmap song, Wenquanyi Micro black, usually cooperate with phantomjs to display Chinese character.
- `phantomjs` A Webkit Browser without UI.

Note ** System-level dependent Function modules will not add by default**, adding system dependencies will slow down the deployment, so please don't add unused dependencies.


###  Environmental variable

The LeanEngine platform provides the following environment variables by default:

Variable name|explanation
---|---
`LEANCLOUD_APP_ID`| Current used APP ID
`LEANCLOUD_APP_KEY`| Current used APP key
`LEANCLOUD_APP_MASTER_KEY`|Current used Master Key
`LEANCLOUD_APP_ENV`| Current application environemnt <ul><li>The development environment does not have this environment variable, or the value of `development` (generally referred to as local development)</li> </li><li>Preparation environment value is `stage`</li><li>Production environment value is `production`</li></ul>
`LEANCLOUD_APP_PORT`|The port that the current application is open to the external network, only by listening this port can the user access you service.
`LEANCLOUD_API_SERVER`| The address used to access the storage service (similar to `https://api.leancloud.cn`). This value can vary depending on reasons like your data center, etc.. So use this value of this environment variable when requesting storage services or LeanCloud other services using the REST API. In the LeanEngine ** Do not use `https://api.leancloud.cn` directly
`LEANCLOUD_AVAILABLE_CPUS`|The number of CPUs available for the LeanEngine instance, this value is greater than 1 for high-spec instances (e.g. 2CPU 1024MB memory). The application can start a corresponding number of threads or processes based on this value. In the LeanEngine ** Do not ** directly use the operating system CPU core, otherwise it may start too many processes and cause the exception to exit because it exceeds the instance specification.
`LEANCLOUD_APP_GROUP`|The group in which the LeanEngine instance is located. When using the LeanEngine [Group Management] (leanengine_plan.html#Group Management) feature, this value is the name of the group.
`LEANCLOUD_REGION`|The area where the LeanEngine service is located, the value of {% if node != 'qcloud' %} is `CN` or `US`, which represents domestic node and the US node respectively. {% else %} currently only supports `CN` or Chinese nodes. {% endif %} 

<div class="callout callout-info">Environment variables (such as `LC_APP_ID`) that are used by older LeanEngines starting with `LC_` have been abandoned. To ensure code compatibility, the `LC_` variable is still valid for a period of time but may fail completely in the future. To avoid errors, it is recommended to use the `LEANCLOUD_` variable instead. </div> 
You can also add custom environment variables to the [LeanEngine > Settings > Custom Environment Variables] (/dashboard/cloud.html?appid={{appid}}#/conf) page. The names of the varaibles must be a letter, a number, an underscore, and begin with a letter. The value must be a string. The environment variable will be modified and will take effect the next time it is deployed. 

According to general practice, some configuration items can be stored in environment variables. In this way, the environment variables can be modified and redeployed to change the behavior of the program without modifying the code, or you can store some Secret Key provided by third-party services in the environment variables so that these secret keys won't appear directly in the code. 

{% block code_calling_custom_variables %}{% endblock %}

{% call docs.alertWrap() %}
The environment variable provided by default by the LeanEngine{% if platformName | lower == 'node.js' %} (and Node.js environment variable `NODE_ENV`){% endif %} cannot be overwritten by custom environment variables (override) invalid). 

{% endcall %}

### Load balancing

On the LeanEngine, the user's request goes through a load balancing component before reaching your app. The load balancing component handles the general work of HTTPS encryption, compression of responses, etc., so you don't have to add HTTPS or gzip-related functionality to your app. 

Load balancing also limits the request to no more than 100M (including direct upload files to the LeanEngine), request processing cannot exceed 60 seconds, WebSocket 60 seconds without data will be disconnected. 

### File System

You can write temporary files to the `/home/leanengine` or `/tmp` directory, up to 1G. 

Each time the LeanEngine is deployed will create a new container. Even if it is not deployed. The system occasionally performs some automatic scheduling, which means that **you can't treat the local file system as a persistent storage**, only for temporary use storage.

If the files you write in are large, it is recommended to delete them automatically after use. Otherwise, if you take up more than 1G of disk space, you may receive errors similar to `Disk quota exceeded` if you continue to write files in. In this case, you can re- Deploy it so that the file will be emptied. 

### Log

In the [LeanEngine/Logs] (/cloud.html?appid={{appid}}#/log) of the console, you can view the LeanEngine's deployment and running logs , and you can also filter them by the log levels. 

You can also [export via command line tool] (leanengine_cli.html#View Log) to save the last seven days of logs to local files for further analysis and statistics. 

The application log can be directly output to "standard output" or "standard error". The information will correspond to the level of`info` and `error` of the log. For example, the following code will record the parameter information at the info level:
{% block loggerExample %}{% endblock %}

<div class="callout callout-info">The log line has a maximum of 4096 characters, and the extra portion is discarded; the log output frequency is greater than 600 lines/minute, and the extra section will be discarded. </div> 

{% block loggerExtraDescription %}{% endblock %}

The LeanEngine's access log (Access Log) can be exported from [App Console > LeanEngine > Access Log] (/cloud.html?appid={{appid}}#/accesslog), you can download the packaged logs via the console. 

### Time zone

In the Chinese area system of the LeanEngine's, Beijing time (`Asia/Shanghai`) is used by default. And the US area system uses UTC time by default. 

{% block section_timezone %}{% endblock %}

### Gateway IP address

If the developer wants to configure the IP whitelist on a third-party service platform (such as WeChat Open Platform) and needs to obtain the LeanEngine portal or egress IP address, go to [Control Panel > LeanEngine > Settings > Portal IP] (/dashboard/ Cloud.html?appid={{appid}}#/conf) to self-check. 

We will minimize the frequency of changes in the IP of the gateway as much as possible, but the possibility of a sudden IP change still exists. Therefore, in the case of problems related to the IP of the portal, we recommend entering the console to check if the IP list has changed. 

## Filing and custom domain names

The [Setting Domain Name] (#Setting Domain Name) mentioned earlier refers to setting a second-level domain name. Strictly speaking, ** is not recommended for direct use in the production environment**, for security reasons and laws and regulations, before you are ready to go into business with your website, you should bind your own registered and already filed domain name. 

If you need to bind your own domain name, go to [App Console > Account Settings > Domain Binding] (/settings.html#/setting/domainbind) and follow the steps to fill in the information.

The binding of independent domain names to domestic nodes requires ICP filing, whilst US nodes do not. 

If you have no ICP filing, please go to [App Console > Account Settings > Domain Recording] (/settings.html#/setting/domainrecord) and follow the steps to fill in the information for filing. In the case that the primary domain name has been filed with LeanCloud, the subdomain does not require additional filing; if the primary domain is filed with other cloud providers, if you need to use the subdomain in LeanCloud, you need to file it again in LeanCloud. 

<div class="callout callout-info">Before filing, the LeanEngine must be, and the content of the website is consistent with the content of the filing application. Enterprise users who only use the LeanEngine to host static files and do not use other LeanCloud services need to complete their own domain name filing.
